###Lombok your project

[Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) is a great tool to keep your codebase clean and focused only on business logic. 
Setting it up on IDE (eclipse in my case) is easy if you follow guidelines given by lombok but setting it up outside IDE is not so simple. I have set it up on my gradle project using following steps. All changes are in build.gradle
